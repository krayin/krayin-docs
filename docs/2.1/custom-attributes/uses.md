# Create and using a new attribute

Krayin CRM is a highly customizable, attribute-based CRM system that allows you to manage various entities such as leads, quotes, contacts, and more through the use of attributes. This flexibility enables you to tailor the system to meet your specific business needs.

- Creating Attributes

To create an attribute in Krayin, follow these steps:

1. **Navigate to the Settings**:
   - In the main dashboard, go to `Settings` in the sidebar menu.
  
2. **Go to Attributes Section**:
   - Under the `Settings` menu, select `Attributes` to manage existing attributes or create new ones.

3. **Create a New Attribute**:
   - Click on the `Create Attribute` button.
   - Fill out the form with the necessary details, such as the name, code, and type of the attribute.

4. **Entity Type**:
   - One of the key fields in the attribute creation form is the `Entity Type`. The `Entity Type` determines where the attribute will be applied in the system. The available entity types include:
     1. **Leads**: Attributes created under this entity type will be associated with the `Leads` module.
     2. **Person**: Use this entity type to create attributes for the `Person` module, allowing you to manage individual contacts.
     3. **Organization**: Attributes for managing organizations and companies can be created under this entity type.
     4. **Products**: Attributes associated with products can be managed under this entity type.
     5. **Quotes**: If you want to manage quotes with specific attributes, select this entity type.
     6. **Warehouses**: This entity type is for managing warehouses and their specific attributes.

5. **Save the Attribute**:
   - After filling in all the required fields, click `Save`. The attribute will now be available for the selected entity type.

- Using Attributes

Once you have created an attribute, it will appear in the respective module based on the entity type you selected during creation. For example:
- If you created an attribute for `Leads`, it will be available when managing or viewing leads.
- Similarly, attributes for `Person`, `Organization`, `Products`, `Quotes`, and `Warehouses` will be accessible within their corresponding entity type

These attributes allow you to add custom fields, data types, and other specific requirements to the respective entities, making Krayin a powerful and flexible CRM solution for your business.

- Summary

Krayinâ€™s attribute system provides extensive customization options, making it easy to manage various CRM entities according to your unique requirements. By selecting the appropriate `Entity Type` when creating an attribute, you ensure that the attribute is applied to the correct module within the CRM. This approach allows you to build a CRM system tailored to your business needs, with custom fields and data management options for leads, quotes, contacts, and more.
