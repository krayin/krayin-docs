## REST API

The Krayin REST API enables seamless integration and interaction with the Krayin CRM system. It follows the REST (Representational State Transfer) architecture, providing a robust set of endpoints for managing CRM-related data.

Key Features

- CRUD Operations: The API supports all basic CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations, allowing for comprehensive management of CRM data including customers, leads, contacts, and more.

- Pagination: To enhance performance and manage large datasets efficiently, the API includes support for pagination. This helps in retrieving data in chunks rather than loading large volumes of data at once.

Integration Capabilities: The REST API is designed to integrate seamlessly with various external systems and applications, including:

- PWA (Progressive Web Applications): Use the API to develop PWAs that interact with the CRM, offering a modern, app-like experience on the web.
Mobile Applications: Integrate with mobile apps to enable functionalities such as customer management, lead tracking, and reporting directly from the mobile interface.
Data Access and Manipulation: The API provides endpoints to access, update, and manage CRM data, ensuring that you can build custom solutions and integrations tailored to your specific business needs.
