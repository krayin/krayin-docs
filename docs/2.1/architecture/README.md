# Architecture concepts
**Krayin** is very easy framework to understand. The goal of this document to give you overview of how krayin works.

We love to work with hot [Opensource](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open_source) softwares so Krayin is built on technologies such as [PHP](https://php.net), [Laravel](https://laravel.com) and [Vue.js](https://vuejs.org/)

As **Krayin** solution for SMEs and Enterprises for complete customer lifecycle management.

Laravel packages are being used to separate each functionality such as Leads, Quotes, Mail, Activities, Contacts, Products Settings, etc.

We developed and used built-in components of Vue.js

**Krayin** registers useful events that are triggered on most of the pages which could enable to perform some custom operations in the application.
